## Random Tips ##
* Use a lot of water when flushing solids
* Change the hot water tank anode (yearly?)
* Tires should be changed every 7 years regardless of the mileage.  For original tires, estimate that they are one year older than the model year of the RV.
* Use a drill with a socket adapter for lowering / raising the stabilizer jacks
* Water fittings come loose occasionally. Check these first when there is a leak.  
* Always turn the fridge off completely if parking for more than a few minutes on unlevel ground.  The fridge needs to be almost perfectly level.

## Toilet Tips ##
* Greywater tanks can be left open when you have full hookup.  Forecast when you will need to dump your blackwater tank, and shut your greywater tank and let your tank fill up.  
*  To prevent backflow, _Never_ dump the blackwater tank with the greywater valve open.
* Camp with the blackwater tank closed, even when you have sewer hookups.  Dump the tanks when it is 2/3 full to minimize the chance of paper plugging the outlet.  RV toilet paper really is better.  
* After dumping the blackwater tank take the time to manually move the sewer line starting at the trailer towards the connection to ensure any solids have been flushed away.   
*  When using a dump station use the same method and dump the blackwater first, and then flush the sewer hose with the greywater.  I have have always seen a hose at the dump stations, so be kind and hose the area down when you are done.  

## Empty blackwater tank ##
* Hopefully you have allowed your greywater tank to fill up at least partially
* Make sure that your greywater tank valve is _closed_
* Double check that your sewer hose connections are closed tight.  If the connection to the sewer itself is questionable, lay a rock or some firewood across it.
* Open the blackwater valve (gloves recommended)
* If you do not hear it rushing, raise and lower the sewer hose nearest to the trailer to get things moving
* It isn't a bad idea, and especially important at the end of the trip to flush the toilet to try and clean anything left hanging around
* Close the blackwater valve
* Open the greywater valve and let it clean out your sewer hose
